    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchains solve the problem of double-spending and thereby allows financial ledgers to be distributed among peers who maintain the invariants collectively without resorting to entrusting a centralized entity with the ledger. At the same time technical limitations still remain, hindering greater adoption of the technology. We identify the biggest unsolved challenges and what is being done to crack the nut. 🥜]]></summary>

Armed with the whitepaper, the yellow paper and the source code for the Go implementation we dive into the inner workings of Ethereum. In this Saturday long read, we cover among other things the state model, the peer-to-peer network, the EVM and the consensus algorithm. Lastly we discuss the Ethereum ice-age and why it exists. So prepare yourself a nice cup of coffee ☕️ and jump in!]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013. Its intended purpose was to provide a blockchain with a Turing-complete programming language allowing users to extend its functionality by uploading custom code. The code could be used to create digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments, the ownership of an underlying physical device, non-fungible assets such as domain names, as well as more complex applications involving having digital assets being directly controlled by a piece of code implementing arbitrary rules  or even blockchain-based decentralized autonomous organizations.]]></summary>

I wrote a <a href="http://appvise.me/2011/03/why-we-are-choosing-clojure-as-our-main-programming-language/">blog post</a> about the decision which got a lot of attention from the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2350381">Hacker News</a> community. While we are extremely happy with our decision we have started to deploy some <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> code on some low memory VPS we deploy.</p>
<p>Some of the machines we deploy are 256M and 512M instances and with multiple instances of the JVM the machines start swapping to disk sooner or later. The other day we needed a simple way to forward all HTTP traffic received by our DNS servers to our website. It seemed like the perfect project to introduce Haskell since the code is independent of everything else and extremely simple; just output a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#3xx_Redirection">HTTP 301 redirect</a> response no matter what was received on the socket.</p>
<p>The resulting code is as close to a networking skeleton written in Haskell which I hope others will benefit from when starting a Haskell project involving network communication. ]]></summary>

He is a professional photographer working for a photo gallery called <a href="http://magg.is/">Magg</a> but with his own <em>clientele</em>. Now facing changes in the photographic scene as the recession begins to creep in he wanted to strengthen his own professional presence. The vehicle for such a requirement was an online photo gallery (due to open this week) with some of his more artistic images.
